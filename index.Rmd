# School Performance Rankings

# School Performance Rankings

--

Every year we see news headlines like these:

--

.pull-left[
```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/best_schools_edin.jpg")

```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/best_schools_mcr.jpg")

```
]

---

# School Performance Rankings

--

- In Scotland, the most frequent metric for the rankings at the secondary school level is: Percentage of pupils achieving 5 or more **"Highers"** qualifications.

--

  - "Highers" is the main qualification to access University in Scotland.
  
  - For equivalence with England, "Highers" sit in between GCSE and A-levels.
  
--

- In England, the most frequent metric for ranking secondary schools is **GCSE results**

--

  - A-levels are also used but less frequently
  

---

# School Performance Rankings

--

- The "model" of school performance as published by newspapers is:

--


```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_performance0a.png")

```

---

# School Performance Rankings



- The "model" of school performance as published by newspapers is:




```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_performance0.png")

```


```{r, out.width = '25%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/shrug.gif")

```

---

# School Performance Rankings

--

- The first problem that comes to mind with that is that we don't know the starting point of each pupil:

--

```{r, out.width = '60%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/unfair_race.jpg")

```

--

- So, how can we make a fair comparison between schools?

---

# School Performance Rankings

--

- The most basic model of school performance is as follows:

--


```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_performance1.png")

```


--

- This is commonly known as a "value-added model" or **VA** model


---

# School Performance Rankings

--

- This is what is done by the DfE in England:

--


```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/performance_table_dfe.jpg")

```

--

- "**Progress 8**" is a value-added measure of performance for secondary schools.


---

# School Performance Rankings

--

- Progress 8 uses attainment at the end of compulsory secondary school ("GCSE") adjusted by attainment at the end of primary school ("Key Stage 2")

--

- But it isn't free of problems:

--

- It doesn't account for pupil characteristics

--

- This is extremely important, by way of analogy:

--

  - Would it be fair to compare hospitals in terms of patients' outcomes if we don't consider the characteristics of the patients?

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

- A fairer model of school performance is as follows:

--


```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_performance2.png")

```


--

- This is commonly known as a "contextualised value-added model" or **CVA** model

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

A CVA model can account for a variety of factors, but here are the main ones:

--

- **Pupil intake characteristics** known to have an impact on attainment:

--

  - Socioeconomic status: Usually "free-school meals" eligibility
  
--

  - Sex of the pupil

--

  - Ethnicity

--

  - Special Education needs and disability (SEND)

--

  - First language or "English as Additional Language"
  
--

- Less used but arguably equally important, **school characteristics**, such as:

--

  - School location (local authority, urban/rural)
  
--
  
  - School size

--

The main idea being that we consider as many elements as possible that are **beyond the control of the school** to make fair comparisons.
  

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

Controlling for socioeconomic factors seems like the best way forward...

--

```{r, out.width = '20%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/that_could_work.jpg")

```

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors



From 2006, CVA measures of school performance were published by the DfE in England, but...

--

```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Source: DfE (2010)"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/cva_scrapped1.jpg")

```

--

So in 2011 CVA was scrapped.


```{r, out.width = '25%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/disappointed.gif")

```


---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors



Scrapped by the Secretary of State who wanted ALL schools to be above average

```{r, out.width = '80%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap = "Source: UK Parliament (2012)"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/above_average_schools_gove.jpg")

```

<br>

```{r, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/wait_what.gif")

```
---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

Of course the idea has not been abandoned by Educational researchers... How could we?

- The three reasons to scrap CVA have already been debunked by Leckie and Goldstein (2017)


```{r, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/leckie_goldstein_2017.jpg")

```

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

### Reason Number 1 to scrap CVA:

--

.pull-left[

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/hard_to_understand.jpg")

```

]

--

.pull-right[

<br>

Problem of communicating the results: Never was a requirement to understand all "the ins and outs"

]

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors


### Reason Number 2 to scrap CVA:

--

.pull-left[

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/less_strong_predictor.jpg")

```

]

--

.pull-right[

<br>

This is a reflection of schools having less of an effect than previously thought

]  


---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors


### Reason Number 3 to scrap CVA:

--

.pull-left[

```{r, out.width = '100%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/different_expectations.jpg")

```

]

--

.pull.right[

<br>

CVA actually rewarded schools for their efforts with historically disadvantaged pupil groups.

]

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

### But does it even matter if we use one model or the other?

--

- This has been looked at by many researchers, and the overwhelming conclusion is that **it matters a lot**

--

- This is an example comparison between VA and CVA models in England:

--

.pull-left[

```{r, out.width = '140%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Leckie and Goldstein (2019)"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_classif_leckie1.jpg")

```
]

--

.pull-right[

- **Progress 8** only includes prior attainment (at the end of primary).

- **Adjusted Progress 8** includes pupil age, sex, ethnicity, language, SEN, FSM and deprivation.

]

```
]

.pull-right[

- **195** schools were "above average" according to Progress 8, but "average" when adjusting for pupil background.

- **172** schools were "below average" according to Progress 8, but "average" when adjusting for pupil background.

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

Here's an example from Chile comparing two different CVA models:

--

```{r, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Troncoso (2019)"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_classif_troncoso.jpg")

```

--

- The less complex model includes pupil background and some school characteristics

--

- The more complex model includes more school characteristics (like local authority and classroom differences)

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors


Here's an example from Chile comparing two different CVA models:



```{r, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="Troncoso (2019)"}

knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patroncos/pint_science_2025/refs/heads/main/images/school_classif_troncoso2.jpg")

```

--

  - **106 schools** were "below average" in the less complex model and "average" in the more complex model

--

  - **162 schools** were "above average" in the less complex model and "average" in the more complex model

---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

### Why does it matter?

--

In both examples, there is a "high-stakes" system whereby these numbers are taken into account when conducting school inspections.

--

- In Chile, consecutive classifications as "below average" could mean closure for schools.

--

- In England, consecutive "inadequate" evaluations could mean "forced academisation" for schools.

--

These are real-life consequences that can affect thousands of pupils.
---

# The impact of socioeconomic factors

--

### What about Scotland?

--

- There is no available **standardised** test in Scotland that can be used as a prior attainment measure.

--

- We can eventually look at grades at the National 5 level (equivalent to GCSE) and adjust for pupil background.

--

- It would be a "Contextualised Attainment" model, not a CVA model.

--

- Maybe in the future...

---

# Conclusions

--

- School performance is a complex process...

--

   - Complex phenomena require the use of reasonably complex methods to analyse them.
   
--

- **Context matters**

--

  - Using unadjusted measures of attainment is unfair

--


- Choosing a school performance model is not a trivial choice

--
  
  - The risk is to be unduly harsh or lenient with some schools
  
--

- Ranking schools is a futile effort for policy

--

  - What matters is to look at the reasons why some schools may be performing below a national average.
  
--
  
  - And perhaps learn from the schools that **against all odds** are performing above the average.

---

# Conclusions

--
### So... what makes a good school?

--

Probably all the things mentioned at the beginning... and more

--

But **no single headline measure is enough**
